This is a very simple version of the famous "Asteroids" arcade game developed using python with pygame.

Usage:
1. Put all but the .gitignore into an empty folder
2. open the terminal and navigate to that folder using cd path/to/folder
3. create an virtual Envionment (VENV) to install pygame only for this little project (if u allready have pygame installed globally on ur machine, this step is not needed) with the command: python3 -m venv venv(only do this once at installation)
4. activate the venv with: source venv/bin/activate (this is needed everytime or u will just get an error on starting the game). Now u should have (venv) written at the start of ur command line

If setting up a venv doesnt work on Windows you can also skip those steps. The requirements of the following step wil just be installed on ur machine in general.

5. Make sure you have python 3.10 or higher installed
5. type in the terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt
6. type in the terminal: python3 main.py
7. have fun(finally)!
