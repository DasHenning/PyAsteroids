This is a very simple version of the famous "Asteroids" arcade game developed using python with pygame.

Usage:
1. Put all but the .gitignore into an empty folder
2. open the terminal and navigate to that folder using cd path/to/folder
3. create an virtual Envionment (VENV) to install pygame only for this little project (if u allready have pygame installed globally on ur machine, this step is not needed) with the command: python3 -m venv venv(only do this once at installation)
4. activate the venv with: source venv/bin/activate (this is needed everytime or u will just get an error on starting the game). Now u should have (venv) written at the start of ur command line
3. type in the terminal: python3 main.py (You need python3.10 or higher to be installed)
4. have fun(finally)!

Controls:
